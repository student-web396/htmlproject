Creating a cookie in PHP is straightforward. Below are the steps and an example to guide you through the process of setting, accessing, and deleting cookies.

### Setting a Cookie

To set a cookie in PHP, you use the setcookie() function. This function must be called before any output is sent to the browser.

<?php
// Set a cookie named "user" with the value "John Doe" that expires in 1 hour
setcookie("user", "John Doe", time() + 3600, "/");

// To make the cookie accessible only via HTTPS
// setcookie("user", "John Doe", time() + 3600, "/", "", true, true);
?>

#### Parameters for setcookie()

- *name*: The name of the cookie.
- *value*: The value of the cookie.
- *expire*: The expiration time (in Unix timestamp). Use time() + (seconds) to set the expiration.
- *path*: The path on the server where the cookie is available. Use "/" to make it available across the entire domain.
- *domain* (optional): The (sub)domain where the cookie is available.
- *secure* (optional): If true, the cookie is sent only over secure HTTPS connections.
- *httponly* (optional): If true, the cookie is accessible only through the HTTP protocol (not by JavaScript).

### Accessing a Cookie

To access a cookie, use the $_COOKIE superglobal array.

<?php
if(isset($_COOKIE["user"])) {
    echo "User is: " . $_COOKIE["user"];
} else {
    echo "User is not set.";
}
?>

### Deleting a Cookie

To delete a cookie, set its expiration time to a past time.

<?php
// Delete the cookie by setting its expiration time to a past time
setcookie("user", "", time() - 3600, "/");
?>

### Example: Complete Cookie Handling

Hereâ€™s a complete example that includes setting, accessing, and deleting a cookie.

#### Setting a Cookie (set_cookie.php)

<?php
// Set a cookie named "username" with the value "JohnDoe" that expires in 1 day
setcookie("username", "JohnDoe", time() + (86400 * 1), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day
echo "Cookie 'username' is set.";
?>

#### Accessing a Cookie (get_cookie.php)

<?php
if(isset($_COOKIE["username"])) {
    echo "Username is: " . $_COOKIE["username"];
} else {
    echo "Username cookie is not set.";
}
?>

#### Deleting a Cookie (delete_cookie.php)

<?php
// Delete the cookie by setting its expiration time to a past time
setcookie("username", "", time() - 3600, "/");
echo "Cookie 'username' is deleted.";
?>

### Using Cookies with Secure and HttpOnly Flags

For enhanced security, you can set cookies with the secure and HttpOnly flags. This ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS and are not accessible via JavaScript.

#### Setting a Secure and HttpOnly Cookie

<?php
// Set a cookie named "user" with the value "John Doe" that expires in 1 hour
// The cookie is only sent over HTTPS and is not accessible via JavaScript
setcookie("user", "John Doe", time() + 3600, "/", "", true, true);
?>

### Summary

- *Setting a Cookie*: Use setcookie() to set a cookie before any output is sent to the browser.
- *Accessing a Cookie*: Use the $_COOKIE superglobal array.
- *Deleting a Cookie*: Set the cookie's expiration time to a past time using setcookie().

By following these steps, you can effectively manage cookies in PHP for various purposes such as user authentication, preferences, and tracking.
